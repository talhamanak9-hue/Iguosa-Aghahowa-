    <h2>Experience and Learning</h2>

<p>
I currently work as a Healthcare Assistant with the NHS, where I support patients and work closely
with healthcare professionals. This role has helped me develop strong communication skills,
professionalism, and the ability to work effectively under pressure.
</p>

<p>
Alongside my professional role, I am studying BSc Computer Science to build the technical knowledge
and practical skills required for a career in IT.
</p>

<p>
Creating and maintaining this portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages is part of my
learning journey and demonstrates my growing confidence with web technologies.
